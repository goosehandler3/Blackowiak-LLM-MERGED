## 📅 Scenario 1: Calendar-Driven Session Notes

**Clinician:** Andrew  
**Use Case:** Weekly sessions with “J03C” (alias for Jordan C.)

### Workflow:
1. Andrew drops a `.ics` export from SimplePractice into the calendar module.
2. The system parses recurring sessions with alias J03C.
3. After today’s session, Andrew launches the GUI and clicks “Today’s Session.”
4. Redactor runs automatically on his raw notes.
5. LLM proposes a SOAP format summary based on his inputs.
6. Andrew tweaks and exports the final version.

**Outcome:**  
✅ Note written in < 5 minutes  
✅ PHI removed  
✅ Style consistent with clinical expectations

## 🔎 Scenario 2: EMDR Log for Trauma Processing

**Client:** A04L (alias for Amanda)  
**Therapy Type:** EMDR

### Workflow:
1. Andrew uses the “EMDR Log” template post-session.
2. He pastes in raw notes with eye movement phases and SUDs rating.
3. Redactor scrubs Amanda’s name and details.
4. LLM formats the notes and flags possible targets or new material.
5. Andrew adds the log to Amanda’s secure record.

**Outcome:**  
✅ EMDR sessions tracked clearly  
✅ Patterns across phases easier to review  
✅ Minimal manual formatting

## 🧠 Scenario 3: Reflective Analysis for IFS Session

**Client:** R08K (alias for Ricky)  
**Therapy Type:** Parts work / IFS

### Workflow:
1. Andrew activates “Parts Language” in the GUI.
2. He inputs:  
   > “Ricky’s anxious part felt eclipsed by a hypervigilant protector. The exile wasn’t ready yet.”  
3. The LLM recognizes IFS dynamics and suggests optional tags (e.g., `[PROTECTOR]`, `[EXILE]`).
4. Note gets saved in a way that facilitates future filtering by parts.

**Outcome:**  
✅ Parts tracked over time  
✅ Internal system map begins to emerge  
✅ Andrew writes less, but captures more

## 🔁 Scenario 4: Psychedelic Integration Support

**Client:** M12S (alias for Maya)  
**Therapy Type:** Psychedelic-assisted (ketamine)

### Workflow:
1. Post-session, Andrew opens the “Psychedelic Integration Journal” view.
2. He speaks into the voice input while thoughts are fresh.
3. Whisper transcribes, redactor cleans, and LLM formats into journal-style prose.
4. Maya’s log is timestamped and ready for reflection next session.

**Outcome:**  
✅ Voice-based input supports immediacy  
✅ Record grows in reflective, nonlinear fashion  
✅ Nothing goes into the EHR until reviewed
