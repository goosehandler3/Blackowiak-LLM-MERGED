   - [ ] Speech-to-text transcription using Whisper
   - [ ] Basic transcript formatting

2. **Local LLM Integration** 
   - [ ] Set up Ollama or similar local LLM runner
   - [ ] Basic prompt engineering for session summaries
   - [ ] Simple SOAP note generation from transcript

3. **Basic CLI Interface**
   - [ ] Command-line tool to process audio files
   - [ ] Output transcript and summary to files
   - [ ] Basic error handling

### Technical Stack for Phase 1:
- **Audio Processing:** `whisper`, `pyannote-audio` (speaker diarization)
- **Local LLM:** Ollama with Llama 3.2 or similar
- **Python Libraries:** `requests`, `json`, `argparse`

### Learning Resources for Beginners:
- Python basics: [Python.org tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- Working with audio: [librosa documentation](https://librosa.org/)
- LLM integration: [Ollama Python client](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python)

## üîß **PHASE 2: ENHANCED PROCESSING**
*Priority: MEDIUM | Timeline: 3-5 weeks*

### Features to Add:

1. **Advanced Audio Processing**
   - [ ] Noise reduction and audio cleanup
   - [ ] Multiple speaker identification (more than 2)
   - [ ] Confidence scoring for transcription quality
   - [ ] Audio chunking for better memory management

2. **Template System**
   - [ ] Integration with existing templates (SOAP, BIRP, etc.)
   - [ ] Template selection based on session type
   - [ ] Custom template creation interface

3. **Privacy & Security**
   - [ ] PHI redaction system using regex patterns
   - [ ] Client name aliasing system
   - [ ] Secure file handling and encryption
   - [ ] Session audit logs

### Technical Additions:
- **Privacy:** `presidio-analyzer`, `presidio-anonymizer`
- **Security:** `cryptography`, `hashlib`
- **Templates:** Custom template engine

## üì¶ **PHASE 5: DEPLOYMENT & DISTRIBUTION**
*Priority: LOW | Timeline: 2-3 weeks*

### Production Ready:

1. **Packaging**
   - [ ] Executable creation with PyInstaller
   - [ ] Installation scripts for different OS
   - [ ] Docker containerization option

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] User manual with screenshots
   - [ ] Video tutorials
   - [ ] Troubleshooting guide

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Unit tests for core functions
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] Performance benchmarking

## üõ†Ô∏è **BEGINNER-FRIENDLY DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**

### For Each Phase:

1. **Start Small:** Build one feature at a time
2. **Test Early:** Test each component before moving on
3. **Use AI Tools:** Leverage ChatGPT/Claude for code generation and debugging
4. **Ask Questions:** Join Python/AI communities for help
5. **Document Everything:** Keep notes on what works and what doesn't

### Recommended Development Workflow:

1. **Fork/Branch:** Create feature branches for each major component
2. **Incremental Commits:** Commit working code frequently
3. **Test Data:** Use the files in `example_data/` for testing
4. **Error Handling:** Add try/catch blocks around risky operations
5. **Logging:** Use Python's `logging` module to track what's happening

### Key Resources:
- **Python Audio Processing:** [Real Python Audio Guide](https://realpython.com/python-speech-recognition/)
- **LLM Integration:** [Ollama Documentation](https://ollama.ai/docs)
- **GUI Development:** [Real Python Tkinter Tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/)
