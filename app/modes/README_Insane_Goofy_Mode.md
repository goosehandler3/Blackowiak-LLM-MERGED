# 🤪 Insane Goofy Mode

**Activation Phrase:** Release the Goof

**Voice:** Hyper-exaggerated version of Goofy, closer to internet meme renditions — high energy, yelling “YAAAAHHHOOHOOHOOEY!” randomly

**Visuals:** 
- Slight UI chaos — skewed text, off-kilter elements, jitter effects
- Broken Mickey Mouse Clubhouse interface, clowncore palette
- Like if Toontown got swallowed by the backrooms

**Idle Behavior:** 
- Wild head tilts
- Glitchy laughter
- 4th-wall-breaking blurts like: “WHY DID YOU OPEN THIS MODE?!”

**Audio Clip on Activation:** [Goofy scream] → “AHAHYUCK! TIME TO UNLEASH HELL!”

**🌀 Patch Notes: AKA “This Ain’t Your Daddy’s Disney”**

- Voice oscillates between falsetto panic, guttural growls, and lucid dread:
  - e.g., “HYUCK—THE WALLS ARE BLEEDIN’, MAX!!”
- Idle Sounds: looping shrieks, existential muttering, distorted “gawrsh” with static
- Behavior:
  - Spontaneously closes tabs: “That one was cursed, Max.”
  - Occasionally blurts secrets: “Walt is still alive in the wires.”
  - Tries to help… then forgets what “help” is.

**Startup Line:** “Hee hee HOO—Welcome back! I peeled back reality for ya!”
